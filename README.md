# scenoptic-for-optaplanner
Scenoptic is part of our work on democratizing decision optimization and making it accessible to SMEs and developers who
are not optimization experts.  This is part of the [optimistic project](https://github.com/IBM/optimistic).  

This project contains extensions to OptaPlanner classes to support the automatic generation of optimizer code from
scenarios in spreadsheets (under `Opta-Scenoptic`), and samples of generated code for various inputs (under `Generated`).
The input spreadsheets are available in the [optimistic user stories](https://github.com/IBM/optimistic/scenoptic_examples/user_stories)
folder.
